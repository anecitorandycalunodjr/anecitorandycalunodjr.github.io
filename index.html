            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">History of Manila</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Manila’s history is rich and spans centuries, beginning as a thriving settlement before becoming the political, economic, and cultural center of the Philippines. Long before Spanish colonization, the area was already inhabited by indigenous communities and Muslim settlers. It was ruled by Rajah Sulayman and his predecessors, who established a flourishing trade with nearby Asian regions, including China, India, and the Malay Archipelago. The name “Manila” comes from “Maynilad,” derived from a flowering plant that grew abundantly along the banks of the Pasig River.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">In 1571, Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived, defeating the local rulers and establishing Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies. The Spanish built Intramuros, a fortified city that became the administrative and religious center of the colony. The city played a crucial role in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, a trade route that connected the Philippines to Mexico and Spain, making Manila a key global trading hub. This economic activity led to the city’s development, but it also made Intramuros a frequent target of foreign invasions, including attacks from Dutch, British, and Chinese pirates.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">After over 300 years of Spanish rule, the Philippine Revolution (1896-1898) erupted, led by Filipino revolutionaries seeking independence. Although it was eventually defeated by the United States in the Spanish-American War and Manila was ceded to the U.S., the Philippines, including Manila, was transferred to the Americans under the Treaty of Paris. Manila saw major infrastructure improvements, including modern roads, schools, and public services. The U.S. also established a new form of government and introduced American culture to the city.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">However, Manila faced immense destruction during World War II, particularly in 1945 when the city became a battleground between American and Japanese forces. The Battle of Manila led to widespread devastation, with a significant portion of the city’s infrastructure and historical landmarks being destroyed. It is considered one of the most tragic episodes in Manila’s history.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">After the war, Manila was rebuilt and officially became the capital of the newly independent Republic of the Philippines in 1946. In the following decades, the city continued to expand, with the rise of modern buildings, commercial districts, and government institutions. Today, Manila remains the heart of the Philippines, blending its rich historical past with rapid urban development. It stands as a testament to the resilience of its people, preserving its heritage while adapting to the demands of modern times.</p>
